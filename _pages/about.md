Hi, My name is <b>Angga Wahyu Prasetia</b>, you can call me <b>Angga</b>. Throughout my present professional career, I have undertaken various developments with utmost sincerity. After graduation from <b>Marine Engineering of ITS</b>, I worked on <b>Kinetik Hydrotech</b> for 7 years to maximize my abilities. I come from a solid engineering background with a strong interest in business and a passion towards strategy.

I studied as a <b>Design Engineer at MMD Laboratory (Marine Manufacturing and Design)</b>, with Solidworks as a main software to deal with 2D drafting, 3D Model, as well as FEA Simulation. Because of licensing, I also work with other alternatives, Inventor now fusion 360, and OnShape for collaboration work. I believe that good design will make work and costs more cost effective, precise, and able to work with certain design parameters.

In advance, I am confident with my electrical skill (both heavy and light current) and fair enough programming skill. With my capabilities in design, electrical, and as a programmer, I made some prototypes for fun.

I Believe the technology is the key of the industry nowadays and in the future to support my companyâ€™s business. I, myself keep a sight of these trends as a new adoption for industry.
