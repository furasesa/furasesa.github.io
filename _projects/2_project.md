Romeo is another robotic project designed using a manual telescopic table. Different from the previous robot, this robot uses 2 MCUs from espressif to handle the motor and camera separately because they are located in a remote location.

There is 2 part of work

## Scheme

Romeo's wiring scheme was created with fritzing
