Automatic Robot Assistant (AuRA) is a smart robot to help distribute patient needs, increase the work efficiency of medical staff and reduce the level of interaction between medical staff and patients. AuRA has several components, 1) a Single Board Computer of Raspberry Pi which makes the robot have various smart features, 2) 4 Mechanum wheels for more stable mobility 3) 14 inch monitor screen with IR 5MP Camera and digital microphone which makes it easier for patients to consult with nurses. AuRA is multifunctional because it is not only used to deliver patient needs but also as a communication medium in hospital services.
